# ETH SF Hack : DAOCensus

To use this design, you would first deploy the AIDecisionMaker contract, which provides the AI decision making logic. Then, you would deploy the MyContract contract, passing in an instance of the deployed AIDecisionMaker contract. The MyContract contract can then use the AI decision making logic provided by the AIDecisionMaker contract in its functions.





Basically a layer of this with a framework approach for implemnt in  web 3.
